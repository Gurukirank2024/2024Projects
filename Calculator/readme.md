 1.Familiarize yourself with the buttons: 
      Take a moment to understand the functions of each button on the calculator. Common buttons include numbers (0-9),

 2.Enter numbers: 
      Start by entering the first number of your calculation. Press the corresponding number buttons on the calculator's keypad.

       After entering the first number, choose the desired arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, percentage, division). 
       Press the corresponding operator button on the calculator. For example, to perform addition, press the "+" button.

 4.Enter the second number:
       Input the second number in the same way you entered the first number.

       Press the equals (=) button to perform the calculation. The calculator will display the result on its screen.
